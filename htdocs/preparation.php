		<h2>Context & Finance</h2>
		<p>Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements during <span class="green">the Nimrod Expedition</span> in 1907–09, the explorer was unsettled, becoming in the words of British skiing pioneer <span class="green">Sir Harry Brittain</span> a bit of a floating gent".</p>
		<img class="medium" src="images/endurance.jpg" alt="Endurance Boat/ship"/>
		<p>He wanted <span class="green">to return</span> to the Antarctic, but his future plans now depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910. The unexpected news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912. This meant a change of focus, no matter what Scott's expedition achieved.
		<span class="underline">Shackleton wrote:</span> </p>
		<blockquote>The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration.</blockquote>

		<p class="green">Shackleton estimated that he would need £50,000 (current value £4,187,000) to carry out the simplest version of his plan.</p>
		<p>The first significant encouragement came in December 1913, when <span class="green"> the Government </span>offered him £10,000, provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources.<span class="green">The Royal Geographical Society</span>, from which he had expected nothing, gave him £1,000 according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum. Lord Rosebery, who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions, gave £50. In February 1914 The New York Times reported that playwright <span class="green">J. M. Barrie</span> a close friend of Captain Scott had confidentially donated $50,000.</p>
